# kaggle_titanic

My attempt at the [kaggle competition "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Inspiration and some code was also taken from Curt Wehrley's [excellent tutorial](https://github.com/wehrley/wehrley.github.io/blob/master/SOUPTONUTS.md).

See file [kaggle_titanic.Rmd](./kaggle_titanic.Rmd) for my code and explanations.
